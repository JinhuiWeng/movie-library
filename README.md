# Movie Library

An online movie library website that allows users to search and save movies. [Live Demo](https://movie-library-gules.vercel.app/)

It consumes my mock [Movie-Library-API](https://github.com/JinhuiWeng/movie-library-api), which is a modified version based on [Mosh Hamedani](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node.git) 

## Functionality
- Unregistered User: Sort movie table, re-populate movie table by genre, search movie by name
- Registered User: Like/save movie + all above
- Admin User: Add new movie to database, edit/delete existing movie + all above

## Built with
- React, particularly class components 
- React-router-dom, react-toastify
- Axios
- Bootstrap(Navigation and Table)
- Lodash
- Joi-browser
- Front-end deployed with Vercel and back-end deployed with Fly.io
